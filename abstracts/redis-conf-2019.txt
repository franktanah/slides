Bambleweeny: Redis with HTTP & OAuth

We’re all dreaming of running Google-scale services, but let’s be honest - the scenarios we usually deal with are many orders of magnitude smaller. Yet, we tend to build systems that are over-engineered, difficult to operate, and still don’t meet our performance needs. What if there was an easier way for apps, backends, and distributed systems to ingest and exchange data and messages? Bambleweeny is a lightweight HTTP/REST based key-value store and message broker that offers identity, access & quota management. It's fast, easy to use, and well-documented. Written in Python, using a Redis backend, deployable in a tiny container. In this talk, we introduce this fast-growing open source project, talk about use cases, architecture and hope to get more contributors!
