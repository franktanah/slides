Breakthrough innovation in virtualization of server and storage technologies have revolutionized the way we provide and consume IT and have so become the enabling technologies for public and private clouds that, in turn, build the backbone for modern software‐defined architectures that power next generation business models.
Design and implementations of networking infrastructure, however, still follow the classic approach similar to how setups looked like twenty years ago and represent a substantial bottleneck. While developments in Software‐defined‐Networking (SDN) are looking to add the flexibility to data centre infrastructure that cater for flexible network provisioning of virtual routers, switches and private networks, only IPv6 will be able to add the scalability that is required to make Machine‐to‐Machine Communication (M2M) and Internet‐of‐Things (IOT) a reality.
Besides an the unimaginably large address space of 340 undecillion unique identifiers IPv6 brings capabilities that simplify network topologies and eliminate needs for constructs that were solely designed to overcome shortcomings in IPv4. Yet, existing data centre infrastructure, application delivery and end‐user devices operate predominantly on IPv4. In this session we will look at the current state of IPv6 implementation in open source software‐defined networking components and data centre infrastructure, the implications on the layers of the OSI model and the possibilities for IPv4 and IPv6 to coexist in hybrid setups that are capable to deliver connectivity for billions of devices.
